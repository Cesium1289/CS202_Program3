Program assignment requirements:


In my “spare” time, I am working on creating truly “online” classes. These are 
not the same as remote classes because everything needs to be distributed
automatically during the week. There isn’t a time when the teacher has 
synchronous discussions with the students. Part of this work involves creating
multitudes of short videos that are in a playlist. For example, in the second week 
of CS162, we have around 12 short 6-10 minute videos that need to be played in a 
particular order. Luckily the concept of a playlist allows for one video to feed 
into the next, and so on. The trouble I am having is in the use of the PSU website 
that really doesn’t support a natural way of putting playlists together. I could 
really use some help!
For this programming assignment, you have been “hired” to design a system 
that would allow media to be managed by your software once uploaded. 
Example operations expected would be to upload media, close caption the 
media, remove the media, publish it for general viewing, or publish it for a 
specific class. Videos that I upload can have comments, attachments, description, 
allow for users to post comments, and much more. Authors can look at the 
CS202 Fall 2020 Programming Assignment 4/5
analytics of how often these videos have been watched (or re-watched). In 
addition, quiz questions can be added to media. For this assignment, I expect at 
least 4 features to be supported for this project in addition to allowing quiz 
questions to be added to the videos. Think of a video with a quiz option is a 
media object plus more.
Each course can have multiple playlists of these media available for the viewers
to step through. It would be nice if the playlists themselves were ordered 
(something it doesn’t look like PSU’s site supports).
Try to make this a user friendly environment and of course at the same time as 
making it object oriented. In Program #4 you are to build the part of the 
application that creates one playlist. In Program #5, allow for classes to be 
supported each with multiple playlists!
Your job is to come up with a design of an OO framework that will support an 
application. The key is to make sure to solve this problem using Object Oriented 
methodologies with dynamic binding and function overloading. The use of 
external data file(s) is necessary
